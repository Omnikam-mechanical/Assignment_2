    "#Importance of Dictionary Keys Being Immutable\n",
    "#In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This immutability is crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "#1Hashing Requirement:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Hashing: Python dictionaries use hashing to quickly access data. A hash function takes the key and returns a fixed-size integer (the hash value), which is used to index the dictionary's internal table.\n",
    "Immutability: Immutable keys ensure that the hash value of the key remains constant throughout its lifetime. If a key were mutable, its hash value could change, leading to inconsistencies and errors in data retrieval.\n",
    "Consistency:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "#2Data Integrity: \n",
    "'''Immutable keys ensure that once a key is used to store a value in the dictionary, \n",
    "it reliably retrieves that value later. Mutable keys could lead to data loss or incorrect data retrieval if their state changes.'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#3Performance:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Efficient Lookups: Immutability guarantees that the hash table's performance remains optimal.\n",
    "Mutable keys could degrade performance by causing hash collisions or requiring rehashing'''\n",
    "\n",
    "#Examples of Immutable vs. Mutable Keys\n",
    "#Immutable Keys\n",
    "#Immutable keys include types like integers, floats, strings, and tuples (as long as the tuples contain only immutable elements).\n",
    "\n",
    "#Integers:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {1: \"one\", 2: \"two\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict[1])  # Output: \"one\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Strings\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}\n",
    "print(my_dict[\"name\"])  # Output: \"Alice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {(1, 2): \"point\", (3, 4): \"vector\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict[(1, 2)])  # Output: \"point\"\n",
    "#Mutable Keys\n",
    "#Mutable types such as lists and dictionaries cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#my_dict = {[1, 2]: \"list\"}  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "Dictionaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_dict = {{'key': 'value'}: \"dict\"}  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "# TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Why Immutability Matters\n",
    "Predictable Behavior:\n",
    "Immutable keys ensure that the dictionary operations (like lookups and updates) behave predictably. For instance, if you use an immutable tuple as a key, you can rely on it to remain stable and retrieve the correct value.\n",
    "Data Integrity:\n",
    "Using mutable keys could lead to scenarios where the data becomes inconsistent. For example, if a list is used as a key and its content changes, it would be impossible to retrieve the original data associated with it.\n",
    "Hash Consistency:\n",
    "An immutable key guarantees that its hash value remains consistent, avoiding potential errors in dictionary access and ensuring efficient performance.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "Dictionary keys need to be immutable to ensure consistent and reliable behavior of hash-based lookups in Python. This immutability guarantees that keys remain unchanged, their hash values stay constant, and dictionary operations perform efficiently. \n",
    "Immutable keys like integers, strings, and tuples are appropriate for use, whereas mutable types like lists and dictionaries are not.'''"
